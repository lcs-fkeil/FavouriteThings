                    This is a Cafe close to my old school in Germany.
                    My friends and I often spend our lunchbreak there as it is our favourite Cafe and almost a tradition.
                    My parents used to go to this excact cafe already when they were younger.
                    Whenever I visit home and meet up with friends we go there.
